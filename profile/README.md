XMapTools is an open-source software solution for the analysis of quantitative chemical data in 2D and 3D.

It provides numerical tools and packages implemented in a guided and versatile environment allowing data to be explored and visualised in your own way, including routines for classification, segmentation, calibration and visualisation via single and multi-channel maps or via binary, ternary and spider diagrams.
